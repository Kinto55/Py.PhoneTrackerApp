# Py.PhoneTrackerApp

 The code starts by importing the necessary modules.
 The first module is json, which is used to parse a JSON string into Python objects.
 Next, pycountry is imported so that we can use country codes in our code.
 Then Tkinter and Label are imported so that we can create a window with an interface for displaying data about phone numbers.
 Finally, Entry is imported so that we can create text fields for entering phone numbers and countries of origin.
 The class starts off by defining __init__() as the constructor function for this class.
 This function takes one argument: App, which will be the instance of our app object when it's created later on in the program (line 6).
 After creating an empty list called self._data_list (line 7), two variables are defined: self._phone_number_list and self._country_list (lines 8-9).
 These lists will store all of the phone number information entered by users into their tracker application later on in the program when they enter their own personal information or someone else enters theirs from another source like Facebook or Twitter etc.).
 Next up comes some configuration settings for our window including setting its background color to white (#3f5efb) and making it resizable
 The code is a Python class that will track the phone number of the user.
 The __init__ function initializes the class with an instance of App, which is used to create and manage widgets in the window.
 The code is telling the window to place widgets on the screen.
 The first widget is a phone number, and it's placed at 170x120.
 The second widget is a track button, and it's placed at 200x200.
 The third widget is a country label, and it's placed at 100x280.
 Lastly, there are two buttons that are linked together with an event handler called Track_location which will be triggered when either of these buttons are pressed.
 The code will create a button with the text "Track Location" and place it on the window.
 The track_button is then bound to an event called Track_location which will be triggered when this button is pressed.
